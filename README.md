# harpgl-boiler

Boilerplate to get quickly started with the [harp.gl](https://www.harp.gl/) map library from Here.com. It involves Typescript and web workers (tricky to fit into webpack). This repo avoids losing precious time when setting this all up.

First clone and enter the new folder:

```
git clone git@github.com:Astrak/harpgl-boiler.git
cd harpgl-boiler
```

Then with yarn:

```
yarn
yarn start
```

or with npm:

```
npm i
npm start
```

=> The browser opens on a working harp instance.
